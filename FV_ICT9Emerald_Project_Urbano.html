        March is being observed as Fire Prevention Month here in the Philippines which is a perfect time to discuss and raise awareness about the causes, hazards, and dangers of fire. State weather bureau PAGASA said the temperature and humidity in March start to reach higher levels, with the hot dry weather causing a rise in reported fire cases around the country. March is one of the hottest months of the year and it marks the beginning of the summer season in the Philippines. It is also the month that has one of the most alarming fire incidents in the country, based on data by the Bureau of Fire Protection (BFP).

			<td>The risk of fire is low when appliances are in good working order. However, appliances don’t always stay in good working order. They can be damaged by microsurges that, over time, stress their electronics. A short can happen at any time, and that can cause a fire. It’s one more reason why you should unplug unused appliances.</td>

			<td>It is important to dispose of cigarettes properly. If a cigarette is littered when not fully extinguished it can become a fire hazard. They can be particularly dangerous because they are left burning and it may not be obvious. A fire started from a cigarette can go unnoticed. A cigarette butt can smolder and then start a fire.</td>
